# aws-serverless-starter
This project provides a comprehensive overview of setting up a project for AWS Serverless development from scratch, following the guide at [Guide: First Serverless Project](https://medium.com/serverlessguru/guide-first-serverless-project-630b91366505).

## What You'll Need to Begin
* an AWS Account
* an AWS User Credential to act as an admin for Serverless operations
* an AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for that admin user
* Node Version Manager (`nvm`)
* Node Package Manager (`npm`)
* `npm` Package for AWS Serverless (`sls`)

## Creating an AWS Account
You can signup for your AWS here at [Signup for AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup), and simply follow instructions in the link at the top of this README.md file.

## Installing `nvm`

## Installing `npm`

## Installing AWS Serverless
The AWS Serverless package is meant to be used as a command line support tool, so with this `npm` package we'll suggest you install it globally outside your project, so it can be available across your workstation.
```
npm install -g serverless
```
